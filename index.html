      <div class="text">A deep dive into the top 3 most sold games of 2023<br><br>
        1. Hogwarts Legacy, by Warner Bros. Games. This game has sold over 22 million copies and this makes it the biggest game of 2023. 
        The game exceeded expectations for both casual and hardcore fans of the franchise.
        <br><br>
        2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, by Activision Blizzard. The game sold over 20 million copies, despite overall negative reviews. 
        This shows that Call of Duty will always be popular despite the games quality itself.
      <br><br>
            3. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, by Nintendo. It was the third biggest game of the year in terms of units sold. The game (as of September 2023) has sold over 19.5 million units, 
        no surprise there as the game was highly anticipated, being the sequel to the critically acclaimed first game.
